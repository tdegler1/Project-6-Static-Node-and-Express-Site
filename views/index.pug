        | This portfolio website showcases the projects I've completed so far. While the featured projects here demonstrate front-end skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, the portfolio website is actually another project that is built with back-end skills such as npm, Node.js, Express and Pug templates.<br>
        | Enjoy the show!
